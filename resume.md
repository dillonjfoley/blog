# Technical Writing Resume
With over 7 years of experience in technical writing and 4 years in global instructional design, I bridge the gap between complex technology and user understanding. My trajectory through Microsoft, Google, and ByteDance has enabled me to perfect the delicate art of content creation. The collaboration with Subject Matter Experts has yielded exceptional results in my pursuit of user-centric documentation.
